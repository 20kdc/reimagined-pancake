# Introduction

## Summary

The reimagined-pancake reference section is meant to be a more traditional class/module/method/variable reference, like that of the online Ruby documentation.

Some parts of this are actually part of `module_rpg1.rb`.

These are marked with the keyword `IPL`, which you will have seen in the table of contents above.

Good luck writing those replacement scripts.

NOTE: Right now this is incomplete!
