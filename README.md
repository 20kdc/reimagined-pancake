# reimagined-pancake

## Summary

Example usages of the RGSS1 engine API to serve as documentation.

Use with (Ancurio's mkxp)[https://github.com/Ancurio/mkxp] for optimal experience.

All .rb, .ini and .png files included as of the first commit are made originally for this project.

All .rxdata files written using R48 (gabien-app-r48).

This is original code and assets to show the API of RGSS1 and thus MKXP.

May it, and R48's format information, serve those wishing to reimplement RPG Maker XP's core scripts well.

## Naming:

The GitHub name generator output this. I found it funny, given a game I know of that uses RPG Maker XP.

I didn't create the repository at that time, though.
